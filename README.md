# video_highlights_creator
This is one of my personal projects, this repository has the code which will trim and concat the input video according to the configurations. 

This is just a quick and dirty upload to github, I will be making the code and description more friendly and usable.

I started this as I wanted to create highlights from my table tennis video footage. So I create a mapping from time_range to a list of labels/tags. And as a result the program creates a video file for each label/tag having the concatenated videos of the time_ranges provided.
